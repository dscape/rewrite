# rewrite
`rewrite` is an implementation of [MarkLogic's URL Rewriter for HTTP Application Servers][11]. `rewrite` aims to provide an expressive language that allows you to specify REST applications. This is intended to make your routing logic simple and easy to maintain:

``` xml
<routes>
  <root> dashboard#show </root> 
  <resource name="inbox"> <!-- no users named inbox --> 
    <member action="sent"/> 
  </resource> 
  <resource name=":user"> 
    <constraints>  
      <user type="string" match="^[a-z]([a-z]|[0-9]|_|-)*$"/> 
    </constraints> 
    <member action="followers"/> <!-- no repo named followers --> 
    <resource name=":repo"> 
      <constraints>  
        <repo match="^[a-z]([a-z]|[0-9]|_|-|\.)*$"/> 
      </constraints> 
      <member action="commit/:commit"> 
        <constraints>  
          <commit type="string" match="[a-zA-Z0-9]+"/> 
        </constraints> 
      </member> 
      <member action="tree/:tag" /> 
      <member action="forks" /> 
      <member action="pulls" /> 
      <member action="graphs/impact" /> 
      <member action="graphs/language" /> 
    </resource> 
  </resource>
</routes>
```

Routes are [matched in the order you specified][17] and they can be [nested][18]. They are dispatched dispatched to a resource XQuery file [providing the action as a request field][26]. 

`rewrite` also enables you to hide specific routes from users given specific constraints.

`rewrite` is designed to work with [MarkLogic][2] Server only. However it can easily be ported to another product that understands XQuery and has similar capabilities. `rewrite` is heavily inspired in the [Rails 3.0 routing][4].

## Usage

In your HTTP Application Server configuration make `rewrite.xqy` the default rewriter script.

*This section doesn't cover how to set up an HTTP Application Server in MarkLogic. If you are a beginner I suggest you start by browsing the [MarkLogic Developer Community site][7] or sign up for [training][8].*

Place the `lib` folder of `rewrite` in your application `root`. Still in the `root`  create a new file named `rewrite.xqy` with the following contents:

``` xquery
xquery version "1.0-ml" ;

import module namespace r = "routes.xqy" at "/lib/routes.xqy" ;

declare variable $routesCfg := 
  <routes>
    <root> users#list </root>
    <get path="users/:id">
      <to> users#show </to>
    </get>
  </routes> ;

r:selectedRoute( $routesCfg )
```

With the `rewrite` in place:

* Request `/` will be dispatched to `/resource/users.xqy?action=list`
* Request `/users/dscape`  will be dispatched to `/resource/users.xqy?action=show&id=dscape`

You can [customize the file path][19] and/or  [store configurations in a file][20]. If you are curious on how the translation from path to file is done refer to "Supported Features". 

Here's an example of how your `users.xqy` might look like:

``` xquery
xquery version "1.0-ml";

import module namespace u = "user.xqy" at "/lib/user.xqy";
import module namespace h = "helper.xqy" at "/lib/helper.xqy";

declare function local:list() { u:list() };
declare function local:get()  { u:get( h:id() ) } ;

try          { xdmp:apply( h:function() ) } 
catch ( $e ) { h:error( $e ) }
```

A centralized [error handler][14] can also be used removing the need for a `try catch` statement. Refer to the wiki section on [using an error handler][21] for instructions.

*This assumes a hypothetical `users.xqy` XQuery library that models users. It also contains a `helper.xqy` module. The `helper.xqy` module is contained in lib as an example but is not part of `rewrite`, so you can/should modify it to fit your needs; or even create your fully fledged [MVC][10] framework.*

## Sample Application

You can find a sample applications in the [Samples][30] wiki page. Just follow the instructions in the read me file to deploy. If you used rewrite and want to contribute a sample application just add it to the wiki page.

## Contribute

Think the documentation sucks? Think the performance is crap? Think `rewrite` is cool but is missing feature X? This is your change to shine: contribute to the project.

1. Message `dscape` on github talking about what you want to accomplish.
2. Fork rewrite in github
3. Create a new branch - `git checkout -b my-branch`
4. Develop/fix the functionality
5. Test your changes
6. Commit your changes
7. Push to your branch - `git push origin my-branch`
8. Create an pull request

### Running the tests

To run the tests simply point an MarkLogic HTTP AppServer to the root of `rewrite`

You can run the tests by accessing:
(assuming 127.0.0.1 is the host and 8090 is the port)

    http://127.0.0.1:8090/test/

**Make sure all the tests pass before sending in a pull request!**

### Report a bug

If you want to contribute with a test case please file a [issue][1] and attach 
the following information:

* Request method, request path, and other parts of the request that are relevant (e.g. request headers)
* routes.xml
* paths.xml (if relevant)
